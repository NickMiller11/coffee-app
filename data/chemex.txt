Place the filter in the Chemex with single fold away from the spout and multiple folds lined up against the spout.
Rinse the filter with hot water to get a nice even seal all the way around and heat the Chemex.
Grind your coffee beans.
Dump the rinse water and put the Chemex on the weight scale.
Add the coffee grounds to the Chemex filter.
Pour 100-150g of hot water on the coffee grounds, trying to saturate them as much as possible.
Stir with a chopstick to make sure there are no dry clumps.
Add the remaining water and wait for it to brew.
